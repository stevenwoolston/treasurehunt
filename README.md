# treasurehunt
I had in mind to create something to replace the tired old Easter Egg hunt. You know the one, where you write out a bunch of clues about where the Easter Bunny hid the Easter eggs and the kids go off and find them.  Well I wanted to bring the Easter Egg hunt into the 21st century, so I decided to create a web page which showed the clues and started a timer to see how long it took the kids to find the eggs.  This is part 1 in a 3 part series where I describe the idea, then live code making the project. In this live coding video I will explain headless WordPress as a data source for the clues and images, Bootstrap framework for the grid layout and components (like modals and buttons), a Javascript stopwatch component and general HTML, CSS and Javascript principles.  I hope you enjoy it. Stay tuned for the second video coming soon.
